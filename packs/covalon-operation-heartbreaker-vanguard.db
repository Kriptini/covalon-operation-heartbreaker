{"name":"Heartbreaker (Vanguard)","content":"<p>Heartbreaker is the sole objective of Phase 2. The players will battle against the Heart of the Maw. If the players earned the bonus rewards from Assemble the Supplies, remind them that they can use them immediately before combat if they wish - it may help them!</p>\n<p>The Heart of the Maw fights to death. If things get too dicey, the players can drink their potion of extraction to escape, but they should be warned that by doing so, they're dooming the rest of their fellow Covalonians to fail.</p>\n<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>GM Note</strong> The Heart of the Maw is an offensive powerhouse that wastes no time before bearing the full force of its ferocity upon the Vanguard party. To start, it should take advantage of its range to cast Phantasmal Calamity upon the party, inflicting massive damage and potentially stunning some of them. It can then follow up with Black Tentacles as the party draws closer before pelting them with alternating Echoing Pulses and Shattering Reverbs to mow them down. When the players draw close to the Heart, it can use Seal Fate to give an enemy weakness to sonic damage and then focus them down with its sonic damage abilities to achieve an instant kill when the party member reaches 0 HP. Upon achieving the quickened condition from Adrenaline, the Heart of the Maw can combo its Echoing Pulse or Shattering Reverb abilities with spells such as Gravitational Pull to set them up for the maximum amount of damage possible. (The Heart is immune to sonic damage, so it shouldn't worry about hurting itself with its own abilities.) The Heart is a spontaneous spellcaster, so it can use the same spell multiple times as long as it has open slots, though it has no signature spells. Some of the Heart's spells can inflict the defeaned condition, and the Heart's Unceasing Rhythm Strike has the auditory trait, so keep in mind that deafened characters will be immune to it. Remember, the Heart has tremorsense out to 500 feet but lifesense only out to 60 feet; if the Heart wants to target a creature that is more than 60 feet away and not touching the ground, it will need to spend one action to use its Seeking Rhythm ability to extend its lifesense for that turn, first (this is good information to reveal after a successful Recall Knowledge check - remember the DC reduction the players earned from Study the Stones). Lastly, don't forget about Offbeat. Although it starts off negligible, over the course of the battle it will inflict significant damage to the players. Adrenaline causes the Heart to gain <em>an additional</em> Offbeat aura, meaning that in addition to the aura dealing more damage, it will also require more Performance checks to completely disable it every round (one successful check per aura).</p>\n<p>Once the Heart of the Maw is defeated, the GM should <strong>immediately</strong> pause the game. Do not reset the combat tracker or change the HP or status of any of the players. What happens next is dependent on what happens at the other Vanguard table.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If the other Vanguard table defeats the Heart of the Maw</strong> the victory condition has been achieved and the event ends in a success.</li>\n<li><strong>If the other Vanguard table fails to defeat the Hart of the Maw</strong> the Heart of the Maw at this table heals for an amount of HP equal to the amount of HP the Heart at the other table had remaining, then continues combat from the exact moment where it was left off, only making adjustments to how many Adrenaline buffs the Heart has active depending on its new HP. Once the Heart is brought to 0 HP again, the event ends in a success.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If both Vanguard tables fail to defeat the Heart of the Maw, there is still a chance for the event to end in a success, but the Vanguard tables will not be able to assist in any capacity.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{},"_id":"UcKDsymuW4BgI1IG"}

{"name":"Study the Maw Stones (Vanguard)","content":"<p>In order to help direct the drill to its destination, a cache of Maw Stones has been brought to the front of the raid operation, and they've been acting strangely since entering close proximity with the Maw. Arto Applefield believes that studying the stones' behavior may reveal clues about the dangers that lurk inside the Maw, but the stones are proving not just resistant, but <strong>defiant</strong> to being studied. </p>\n<p>Each of the five stones has a Problem that is preventing it from being studied. Each Problem is a small puzzle that can be solved if a player character performs certain actions - no rolls are required, simply using the action is enough to result in success. The players will need to work together to deduce the solution to each Problem in order to learn all they can from the stones. Players may attempt solutions to Problems as many times as they would like, but if they spend a large amount of time on studying the stones, they should be reminded that they have other objectives that need to be completed. Players cannot pause studying to move onto another objective and then come back to try studying again later; the stones need to be inserted into the drill's navigational system and will no longer be available for study. If players are stuck on finding a solution to a Problem, they can attempt a <strong>DC 26 </strong>check to Recall Knowledge - on a success, they gain a hint at a Problem's solution, depending on whether they use Arcana, Occultism, Nature, Religion, or Society.</p>\n<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>GM Note </strong>Below, each Problem is written in bold, with solutions following after and the corresponding hint given on a successful Recall Knowledge check in parenthesis at the end. Solutions are not comprehensive; if a player comes up with a particularly clever solution, you as the GM should allow it as a solution.</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One of the stones has frozen solid.  </strong>This Problem can be solved by using an action that has the fire trait or by using any effect that deals fire damage. Lit torches, as well as using flint and steel, can also solve this Problem. (Arcana: \"The stone needs to be thawed before it can be studied.\")</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One of the stones is babbling incoherently. </strong>If any player in the party speaks Aklo, they automatically solve this Problem. Otherwise, the players will need to use an effect that allows them to understand Aklo or find some other way to nonverbally communicate with the stone, such as by using the join pasts or other diviniation spells or effects. This stone is intelligent and will attempt to use whatever effects the players cast upon it to aid in solving the Problem. For example, if the players find a way to give the stone the ability to manipulate an ink and quill or charcoal on paper, it can draw pictures to solve the Problem. (Occultism: \"It sounds like the stone is speaking in Aklo. If we don't understand Aklo, we'll need to find another way to communicate with it.\")</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One of the stones has grown teeth and is trying to bite people </strong>This Problem can be solved by feeding the stone any alchemical or magical food or drink or an alchemical bomb, or by using an effect on the stone that imposes the sickened condition. The stone's voracious hunger cannot be satiated by mundane food, so normal rations will not solve the Problem. Alternatively, wedging a spherical item made of metal, stone, or hard wood that is exactly 1 bulk into the stone's mouth can solve the Problem. (Nature: \"If the stone is hungry, we'll have to find a way to either sate its appetite or lose it.\")</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One of the stones turns invisible whenever someone looks at it. </strong>This Problem can be solved by using the Avert Gaze action, an effect that grants see invisibility, glitterdust or similar effects, or looking at the stone through the reflection of a mirror. Blindfolding a player is not an appropriate solution to this Problem, as then that player wouldn't be able to see and therefore couldn't study the stone. Magical darkness, combined with the ability to see through that magical darkness would suffice as a solution, however. (Religion: \"The stone only seems to turn invisible when someone is looking at it directly. Is there a way to look at the stone indirectly?)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One of the stones rolls away whenever someone tries to pick it up. </strong>This Problem can be solved by using the Request or Coerce actions to ask/demand the stone to stay put. The stone is quick and slippery; a character's own strength, reflexes, or mundane gear won't be enough to solve this Problem, but spells or magic items with mind-affecting abilities may suffice. (Society: \"The stone is too difficult to catch with our hands, but maybe we can convince it to cooperate.\")</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Completeing the objective successfully depends on how many Problems the players solve.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>5 Problems Solved</strong> The party gains great insight into their primary target - the Heart of the Maw.

{"_id":"pFkuvJxrujDTL1jy","name":"Study the Maw Stones (Vanguard)","content":"<p>In order to help direct the drill to its destination, a cache of Maw Stones has been brought to the front of the raid operation, and they've been acting strangely since entering close proximity with the Maw. Arto Applefield believes that studying the stones' behavior may reveal clues about the dangers that lurk inside the Maw, but the stones are proving not just resistant, but <strong>defiant</strong> to being studied. </p>\n<p>Each of the five stones has a Problem that is preventing it from being studied. Each Problem is a small puzzle that can be solved if a player character performs certain actions - no rolls are required, simply using the action is enough to result in success. The players will need to work together to deduce the solution to each Problem in order to learn all they can from the stones. Players may attempt solutions to Problems as many times as they would like, but if they spend a large amount of time on studying the stones, they should be reminded that they have other objectives that need to be completed. Players cannot pause studying to move onto another objective and then come back to try studying again later; the stones need to be inserted into the drill's navigational system and will no longer be available for study. If players are stuck on finding a solution to a Problem, they can attempt a <strong>DC 26 </strong>check to Recall Knowledge - on a success, they gain a hint at a Problem's solution, depending on whether they use Arcana, Occultism, Nature, Religion, or Society.</p>\n<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>GM Note </strong>Below, each Problem is written in bold, with solutions following after and the corresponding hint given on a successful Recall Knowledge check in parenthesis at the end. Solutions are not comprehensive; if a player comes up with a particularly clever solution, you as the GM should allow it as a solution.</p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One of the stones has frozen solid.  </strong>This Problem can be solved by using an action that has the fire trait or by using any effect that deals fire damage. Lit torches, as well as using flint and steel, can also solve this Problem. (Arcana: \"The stone needs to be thawed before it can be studied.\")</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One of the stones is babbling incoherently. </strong>If any player in the party speaks Aklo, they automatically solve this Problem. Otherwise, the players will need to use an effect that allows them to understand Aklo or find some other way to nonverbally communicate with the stone, such as by using the join pasts or other diviniation spells or effects. This stone is intelligent and will attempt to use whatever effects the players cast upon it to aid in solving the Problem. For example, if the players find a way to give the stone the ability to manipulate an ink and quill or charcoal on paper, it can draw pictures to solve the Problem. (Occultism: \"It sounds like the stone is speaking in Aklo. If we don't understand Aklo, we'll need to find another way to communicate with it.\")</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One of the stones has grown teeth and is trying to bite people </strong>This Problem can be solved by feeding the stone any alchemical or magical food or drink or an alchemical bomb, or by using an effect on the stone that imposes the sickened condition. The stone's voracious hunger cannot be satiated by mundane food, so normal rations will not solve the Problem. Alternatively, wedging a spherical item made of metal, stone, or hard wood that is exactly 1 bulk into the stone's mouth can solve the Problem. (Nature: \"If the stone is hungry, we'll have to find a way to either sate its appetite or lose it.\")</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One of the stones turns invisible whenever someone looks at it. </strong>This Problem can be solved by using the Avert Gaze action, an effect that grants see invisibility, glitterdust or similar effects, or looking at the stone through the reflection of a mirror. Blindfolding a player is not an appropriate solution to this Problem, as then that player wouldn't be able to see and therefore couldn't study the stone. Magical darkness, combined with the ability to see through that magical darkness would suffice as a solution, however. (Religion: \"The stone only seems to turn invisible when someone is looking at it directly. Is there a way to look at the stone indirectly?)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One of the stones rolls away whenever someone tries to pick it up. </strong>This Problem can be solved by using the Request or Coerce actions to ask/demand the stone to stay put. The stone is quick and slippery; a character's own strength, reflexes, or mundane gear won't be enough to solve this Problem, but spells or magic items with mind-affecting abilities may suffice. (Society: \"The stone is too difficult to catch with our hands, but maybe we can convince it to cooperate.\")</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Completeing the objective successfully depends on how many Problems the players solve.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>5 Problems Solved</strong> The party gains great insight into their primary target - the Heart of the Maw.

If the players earned the bonus rewards from Assemble the Supplies, remind them that they can use them immediately before combat if they wish - it may help them!</p>\n<p>The Heart of the Maw fights to death. If things get too dicey, the players can drink their potion of extraction to escape, but they should be warned that by doing so, they're dooming the rest of their fellow Covalonians to fail.</p>\n<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>GM Note</strong> The Heart of the Maw is an offensive powerhouse that wastes no time before bearing the full force of its ferocity upon the Vanguard party. To start, it should take advantage of its range to cast Phantasmal Calamity upon the party, inflicting massive damage and potentially stunning some of them. It can then follow up with Black Tentacles as the party draws closer before pelting them with alternating Echoing Pulses and Shattering Reverbs to mow them down. When the players draw close to the Heart, it can use Seal Fate to give an enemy weakness to sonic damage and then focus them down with its sonic damage abilities to achieve an instant kill when the party member reaches 0 HP. Upon achieving the quickened condition from Adrenaline, the Heart of the Maw can combo its Echoing Pulse or Shattering Reverb abilities with spells such as Gravitational Pull to set them up for the maximum amount of damage possible. (The Heart is immune to sonic damage, so it shouldn't worry about hurting itself with its own abilities.) The Heart is a spontaneous spellcaster, so it can use the same spell multiple times as long as it has open slots, though it has no signature spells. Some of the Heart's spells can inflict the defeaned condition, and the Heart's Unceasing Rhythm Strike has the auditory trait, so keep in mind that deafened characters will be immune to it. Remember, the Heart has tremorsense out to 500 feet but lifesense only out to 60 feet; if the Heart wants to target a creature that is more than 60 feet away and not touching the ground, it will need to spend one action to use its Seeking Rhythm ability to extend its lifesense for that turn, first (this is good information to reveal after a successful Recall Knowledge check - remember the DC reduction the players earned from Study the Stones). Lastly, don't forget about Offbeat. Although it starts off negligible, over the course of the battle it will inflict significant damage to the players. Adrenaline causes the Heart to gain <em>an additional</em> Offbeat aura, meaning that in addition to the aura dealing more damage, it will also require more Performance checks to completely disable it every round (one successful check per aura).</p>\n<p>Once the Heart of the Maw is defeated, the GM should <strong>immediately</strong> pause the game. Do not reset the combat tracker or change the HP or status of any of the players. What happens next is dependent on what happens at the other Vanguard table.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If the other Vanguard table defeats the Heart of the Maw</strong> the victory condition has been achieved and the event ends in a success.</li>\n<li><strong>If the other Vanguard table fails to defeat the Hart of the Maw</strong> the Heart of the Maw at this table heals for an amount of HP equal to the amount of HP the Heart at the other table had remaining, then continues combat from the exact moment where it was left off, only making adjustments to how many Adrenaline buffs the Heart has active depending on its new HP. Once the Heart is brought to 0 HP again, the event ends in a success.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If both Vanguard tables fail to defeat the Heart of the Maw, there is still a chance for the event to end in a success, but the Vanguard tables will not be able to assist in any capacity.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7RtLbrlfn9D7fL4K":3},"flags":{}}
