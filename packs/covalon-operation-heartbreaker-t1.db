The Drakeslayer Mawguard prefers to start combat at range, using his Charged Javelin or Horizon Thunder Sphere spells to open up on a target and trigger his Drakeslayer Surge ability, then close in for Drakeslayer Longspear strikes on his next turn while setting up flanking for the Executioner Mawguard. Generally speaking, the Drakeslayer Mawguard should alternate turns of Cast a Spell + Stride/Strike and Strike + Cast a Spell in order to benefit the most from his Drakeslayer Surge reaction and Lightningrod passive. The Executioner Mawguard can use his Executioner Slam or Executioner Charge abilities to stay mobile around the battlefield and get into flanking with the Drakeslayer Mawguard. After using another attack action, the Executioner Mawguard can unleash his devastating Execute ability to control the players' action economy. If one of the Mawguards dies, the other Mawguard should prioritize using Mawguard Assimilation over anything else.</p>\n<p>Once both of the Elite Mawguards are defeated, the event gains 1 Victory Point and a Vein of the Heart reveals itself from the floor of the Maw. Each player gets three actions to deal as much damage to it as they possibly can, with every Strike being an automatic critical success and every save from the Vein treated as a critical failure. After each player has had the chance to act, the Vein retreats into the floor of the Maw. The GM should add up all the damage dealt to the Vein by the players and let them know the total - this has no gameplay effect and is just for the \"cool factor,\" but don't tell the players that.</p>\n<p>At this time, the players can choose to retreat or to continue to assist in the operation by battling another encounter after 20 minutes of exploration activities. If they choose to battle another encounter, use the same enemies from Defend the Drill in Phase 1. Each additional encounter defeated this way awards the event 1 Victory Point and grants the party 10 minutes of exploration activities.

{"_id":"Q8cu6lzFATgPs2XT","name":"Defend the Drill (T1)","content":"<p>This objective tasks with requiring the players to lend a hand in assembling the giant clockwork drill that will be used to force an entry point into the Maw, but during the assembly process, the players are interrupted by a scouting party of a Fighter Mawguard, Oracle Mawguard, and Ranger Mawguard. The Mawguards engage the players in combat, but they have their own objective: to destroy the drill.</p>\n<p>Players should be informed that the drill begins combat with 10 Armor Plating. Once per turn, if it is the target of a Strike or affected by a damaging effect, it loses 1 Armor Plating, regardless of the amount of damage dealt. (For ranged Strikes, Armor Plating is only lost if the attack is made within the first range increment.) If the drill has lost any armor plating, a player adjacent to the drill with a free hand can spend one action to attempt a <span data-pf2-check=\"crafting\" data-pf2-dc=\"16\" data-pf2-traits=\"manipulate\" data-pf2-label=\"Reinforce DC\" data-pf2-show-dc=\"gm\">Crafting check</span> to reinforce the drill with scraps from the destroyed plating. This gives temporary Armor Plating to the drill. Temporary Armor Plating doesn't stack, and it doesn't count towards success at the end of the objective. At any time during the battle, the players can choose to retreat, though doing so triggers a 0 Armor Plating failure.</p>\n<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>GM Note</strong> Enemy creatures should attempt to attack the drill once per turn if it's convenient for them. If they don't have a convenient way to attack the drill from their current position, they should tactically move themselves closer to the drill as they attack the PCs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Critical Success</strong> The drill gains 2 temporary Armor Plating.</li>\n<li><strong>Success</strong> The drill gains 1 temporary Armor Plating.</li>\n<li><strong>Failure </strong>No Armor Plating is restored to the drill.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Completing the objective successfully depends on how much Armor Plating is left at the end of the encounter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>6+ Armor Plating </strong>The drill sustains almost no damage and requires minimal repairs.

The players will battle against the Drakeslayer Mawguard and the Executioner Mawguard. If the players earned the bonus rewards from Assemble the Supplies, remind them that they can use them immediately before combat if they wish - it may help them!</p>\n<p>The Elite Mawguards fight to the death, but if things get too dicey for the players, they can retreat at any time by drinking their potions of extraction.</p>\n<p data-visibility=\"gm\"><strong>GM Note</strong> The Drakeslayer Mawguard and Executioner Mawguard fight in tandem, and are intelligent enough to use combat tactics such as flanking and Demoralize. The Drakeslayer Mawguard prefers to start combat at range, using his Charged Javelin or Horizon Thunder Sphere spells to open up on a target and trigger his Drakeslayer Surge ability, then close in for Drakeslayer Longspear strikes on his next turn while setting up flanking for the Executioner Mawguard. Generally speaking, the Drakeslayer Mawguard should alternate turns of Cast a Spell + Stride/Strike and Strike + Cast a Spell in order to benefit the most from his Drakeslayer Surge reaction and Lightningrod passive. The Executioner Mawguard can use his Executioner Slam or Executioner Charge abilities to stay mobile around the battlefield and get into flanking with the Drakeslayer Mawguard. After using another attack action, the Executioner Mawguard can unleash his devastating Execute ability to control the players' action economy. If one of the Mawguards dies, the other Mawguard should prioritize using Mawguard Assimilation over anything else.</p>\n<p>Once both of the Elite Mawguards are defeated, the event gains 1 Victory Point and a Vein of the Heart reveals itself from the floor of the Maw. Each player gets three actions to deal as much damage to it as they possibly can, with every Strike being an automatic critical success and every save from the Vein treated as a critical failure. After each player has had the chance to act, the Vein retreats into the floor of the Maw. The GM should add up all the damage dealt to the Vein by the players and let them know the total - this has no gameplay effect and is just for the \"cool factor,\" but don't tell the players that.</p>\n<p>At this time, the players can choose to retreat or to continue to assist in the operation by battling another encounter after 20 minutes of exploration activities. If they choose to battle another encounter, use the same enemies from Defend the Drill in Phase 1. Each additional encounter defeated this way awards the event 1 Victory Point and grants the party 10 minutes of exploration activities.
